## Motivation
Concrete can be modeled and understood considering it as a multiscale material consisting of different scales such as macroscale, mesoscale and microscale .Macroscale of concrete is considered as homogeneous, but internally concrete is heterogeneous in nature. Mesoscale models are widely used to understand the mechanical properties and failure mechanisms of concrete, contribution of its phases to the behavior and to obtain homogenized responses in macroscale accurately while considering the heterogeneous properties. Concrete is a complex heterogeneous material, and thus, it is important to develop numerical modeling methods to enhance the prediction accuracy of the fracture mechanism. In order to comprehensively comprehend the failure process of concrete, inherent heterogeneous nature of concrete needs to be considered and mesoscale modelling has proven to be the most effective way of understanding the fracture behavior due to its capability of modelling these heterogeneities.
## Purpose
•To understand the mechanical behavior and durability characteristics of concrete.

•Fracture mechanics of concrete and how to improve the performance of concrete. By using mesoscale models to simulate the behavior of concrete, number of experimental tests can be reduced.
