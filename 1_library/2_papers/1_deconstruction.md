## Motivation
Concrete can be modelled and understood considering it as a multiscale material consisting of different scales such as macroscale, mesoscale and microscale as shown in Fig. 1 [1]. Macroscale of concrete is considered as homogeneous, but internally concrete is heterogeneous in nature. Mesoscale models are widely used to understand the mechanical properties and failure mechanisms of concrete, contribution of its phases to the behavior and to obtain homogenized responses in macroscale accurately while considering the heterogeneous properties. Mesoscale modelling of concrete provides a unique method to investigate the complex damage in- itiation of microcracks, coalescence of these microcracks to form major cracks contributing to the failure of concrete [2] and also the localized deformations which cannot be captured using continuum homogeneous models. In order to comprehensively comprehend the failure process of concrete, inherent heterogeneous nature of concrete needs to be considered and mesoscale modelling has proven to be the most effective way of understanding the fracture behavior due to its capability of modelling t
