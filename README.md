Study the fracture mechanics of concrete using Mesoscale model
---
**Abstract**
---
Concrete can be considered as a heterogeous material at mesoscale consisting of mainly three phase such as aggregates , motar and ITZ. Mehanical behaviour of concrete is depend on the mesoscale structure of concrete.
Developments in mesoscale modelling of concrete considering different analysis
1) Continunuum Finite Element Analysis
2) Discrete Element Method

1)**Introduction **
---
Meso sacale model are used to understand the Mechanical behaviour, and failure mechanisms of concrete. Due to inherent heterogenous natue of concrete needs to be considered and mesoscale modelling has proven to be the most effective way of understanding the fracture behaviour due to its capability of modelling these heterogenities 
Mesoscale modelling can be divided into two segment as continuum mesoscale modelling and discrete mesoscale modelling. Continuum mesoscle modelling represents the mesostructure of concrete as continuum and mainly uses finite element method for analysis. Discrete mesoscale modelling represent the concrete mesostructure using distinct element such as spheres, lattice beams, truss etc.There are many pros and cons for each analysis.

2)**Generation for geometry for meso-scale - continuum method**

In continuum method, concrete mesostructure is represented as a continuum with aggregates, motar, and ITZ. Generally there are two methods to generate geometry in the continuum mesosale modelling.First one is using digital image based approach which uses image-processing techniques and the other method is generating the mesostructue through parameterization modelling.
